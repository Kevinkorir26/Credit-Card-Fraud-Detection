# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Data Analysis and Model building for Credit Card Fraud Detection
project overview
This project focusses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraud cases being rare compared to non-fraud cases. The goal is to build an effective model that minimizes false positives while maximizing fraud detection
